# Atelier2_Javascript_et_POO
# Mini Blog

## Objective
The main objective of this mini-project is to practice object-oriented programming concepts using the JavaScript language. The mini-blog will allow creating, displaying, and managing users and posts.

## Exercise 1

### Description
In this exercise, we will create a class hierarchy to represent different car brands. The base class will be `Car`, then we will have two subclasses `Hyundai` and `Ford`.

### Features
1. Create a constructor function `Car` with attributes "model", "brand", "year", "type", and "fuel".
2. Create a list of cars.
3. Implement the inheritance mechanism between the `Car` class and the `Hyundai` class (with specific attributes "series" and "hybrid") and `Ford` class (with the specific attribute "options").
4. Sort and display the cars in ascending order of years.

## Exercise 2

### Description
In this exercise, we will create objects `Student` and `Teacher` with specific attributes and corresponding methods.

### Features
1. Create two native objects `Student` with attributes "name", "firstname", "age", and "cne", and `Teacher` with attributes "name", "age", and "cin".
2. Add a method `study()` to the `Student` object, then add a method `teach()` to the `Teacher` object.
3. Sort students in alphabetical order of names and firstnames.

## Exercise 3

### Description
In this exercise, we will use JavaScript ES6 to define classes `Vector2D`, `Rectangle`, `Square`, `Point`, and `Segment`.

### Features
1. Define a class `Vector2D` with a constructor providing default coordinates of a vector in the plane and methods to display and add two vectors.
2. Define a class `Rectangle` with a constructor providing default values and methods to display and calculate the surface.
3. Define a class `Square` inheriting from `Rectangle` and overriding the instance attribute "name".
4. Define a class `Point` with a constructor providing default coordinates of a point in the plane.
5. Define a class `Segment` composed of two instances of the `Point` class.

## Exercise 4

### Description
In this exercise, we will set up a mini blog with features to add posts, display the list of posts, and manage users.

### Features
- Create a user interface to add posts.
- Display the list of posts with user details.
- Implement user management with the creation of new users.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Explore the different features of the mini blog.
